    <p>
      Quinta da Casa Amarela has opened its doors to all visitors in 1996, when
      the Port Wine Route was launched. Since the beginning, our aim has always
      been to provide creative and innovative offers with a playful and
      educational nature that would lead wine tourists to discover and enrich
      their culture about wine. Thus, all visits and tastings are varied and
      integrated in a welcoming and familiar environment.
    </p>
    <h2 class="award">
      “Quinta da Casa Amarela” was awarded nationally with the “Enotourism of
      the Year” award for excellence, awarded by Revista de Vinhos in 2006.
